# Bit-level Operations and Float Number Representations (Float i2f)
This is a short program in C that implements floating-point functions, operating directly on bit-level representations of floating-point numbers.
This program replicates the conventions for IEEE floating-point operations, including using round-to-even mode when rounding is required.
