This is a Flight Scheduler application. This is a GUI-interfaced and database-driven (derby) application. The project practices good Object Oriented Design and Database Design.

The project includes 5 classes - `Passenger`, `Flight`, `Day`, `BookingQueries` and `Waitlist`. And it implements the following commands: Add Passenger; Book Customer by Day and Flight; Check Booking / Waitlist status by Day and Flight; Cancel Booking and automatically rebook passenger from waitlist; Drop Flight on a certain Day and automatically rebook confirmed passengers.
