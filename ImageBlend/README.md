This project was originally written as Project 1 for [CMPEN-454](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~rtc12/CSE486/) of Fall 2019 at Penn State University, taught by [Associate Professor Robert Collins](http://www.cse.psu.edu/~rtc12/).

For this project, my program generates multi-scale pyramid representations of images and use them in a computer graphics application, namely blending portions of two images together. Specific tasks will include generating a multi-scale Gaussian pyramid, generating from that a Laplacian of Gaussian pyramid (using DoG approximation), choosing two images to blend together and generating a binary mask saying which pixels should come from which image, and finally, doing the blend using the Gaussian and LoG pyramids computed for each image.

To read more about how this program works and what results I get, please goto [`ProjectReport.pdf`](https://github.com/lizhewen/image_blend/blob/master/ProjectReport.pdf) file for more information.

A special thanks to Prof. Collins for making this interesting project available and to my teammate Xiaoxi Wang for putting up some descriptive parts of the report.
